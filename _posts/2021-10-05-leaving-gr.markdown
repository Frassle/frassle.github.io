Today was my last day at [G-Research](https://www.gresearch.co.uk/).

I've been at GR for just over three years, working in the Realtime Platform Development group. I was mostly building the system used for large scale compute work (Turns out quant finance involves a lot of computation over a lot of data), which was an incredibly fun challenge which I will miss. More than that I'll miss the team I was on. The people at GR are in general incredibly nice and also incredibly smart which is a wonderful environment to work in, but my team were also well into nerding out about languages, type systems, and functional programming which made them an extra joy to be with.

If type driven functional development for solving large scale problems sounds like your cup of tea GR is [hiring](https://www.gresearch.co.uk/role/R875-Realtime-Platform-Software-Engineer/).

As for me, I've got a little break for this week and will have an update soon for what's next.
