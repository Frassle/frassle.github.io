Today I finally set up github pages with Jekyll. I've copied across a couple of my posts from my old blogger site that I still like ([1]({% post_url 2012-09-11-traces-in-voxel-space %}), [2]({% post_url 2012-09-12-traces-in-voxel-space-continued %})).

I've got plans for a couple of other thoughts I'd like to write which are too long for twitter, so I'll ramble about them here.
